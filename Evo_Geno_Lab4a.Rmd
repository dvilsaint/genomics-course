## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```
```{r}
surveys_complete <- read_csv("data/surveys_complete.csv")
```

```{r, build}
### To build a ggplot, we will use the following basic template that can be used for different types of plots:
ggplot(data = surveys_complete, mapping = aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length))
```

```{r, new}
ggplot(data = surveys_complete, aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r, builditeravely}
ggplot(data = surveys_complete, aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +
    geom_point()
```

```{r, modify1}
ggplot(data = surveys_complete, aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.1)
```

### Challenge
```{r, challenge1}
ggplot(data = surveys_complete, 
       mapping = aes(x = species_id, y = weight)) +
   geom_point(aes(color = plot_type))
```

```{r, boxplot}
ggplot(data = surveys_complete, mapping = aes(x = species_id, y = weight)) +
    geom_boxplot()
```

```{r, addpoints}
ggplot(data = surveys_complete, mapping = aes(x = species_id, y = weight)) +
    geom_boxplot(alpha = 0) +
    geom_jitter(alpha = 0.3, color = "tomato")
```
